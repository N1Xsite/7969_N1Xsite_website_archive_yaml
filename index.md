### Welcome to my webspace baby <3
Lets not waste our time with vad colors in fg-bkg -- getcha own (p.s. i keep myself on 
`^setmode=MODE666 --transparent$ ~#:`
funny you're the broken one and i'm the only one to make you say it.

Well, mostly here >> at my <3 http://n1x.site <<< you can NOT (directly) access everything. Rules are all the same as with any of my previous homenetspaces, funny!weird peeps stay away. Don't login to http[s]://MYACCOUNT.n1x.site/[@your_username_kid] whenever the GREEN check is off. (Theoretically, myaccounts.n1x.site/ should not resolve unless the forum server is running [i mean LIVE] on my RaPi server, back at No. XX, Golden N. and also you can >>> ASK ME <<< for a special_friends account : )

---

Also, ALSO: $ YOUR IP has been recorded (by me, i believe) and i can ^ALSO$ get nasty inasmuch if you plan likewise.
